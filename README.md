# World_Weather_Analysis
The purpose of this repository is to collect and analyze weather data across cities worldwide.
And PlanMyTrip will use the data to recommend ideal hotels based on clients' weather preferences.
Weather_Database.ipynb retrieves the Weather Data and outputs it into a readable csv.
Vacation_Search.ipynb creates a Customer Travel Destinations Map to represent the findings through hotels in the region.
And Vacation_Itinerary.ipynb creates a Travel Itinerary Map to show an example of multiple destinations and the routes to get there via selected mode of travel.
